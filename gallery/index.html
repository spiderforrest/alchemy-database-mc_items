                <h3>Core memory NVRAM decoder</h3>
                <p>
                    An odd cross between real world
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic-core_memory"
                        >magnetic core memory</a
                    >
                    and
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_rope_memory">core rope memory</a>,
                    this decoder takes up 3x1x10 blocks per bit, and takes 3-4/10ths of a second to
                    do, a read operation. The reads are non-destructive, but writing can only flip a
                    bit, not set it, so the write signal is propagated backwards, requiring some odd
                    external wiring. Unlikely I'll ever use it, but the idea was sweet.

                <h3>Early prototype chest hall</h3>
                <p>
                    An early prototype for the chest hall. My biggest stretch goal for this system
                    has been to have 12 chests per 'slice' of the chest hall-it's still 58ish meters
                    long, with that many chests. Most systems only have 8, and I don't wanna walk
                    that far.

                <h3>An old hall that was square</h3>
                <p>
                    In hindsight this hall has a million things wrong with it. I'd explored a bunch
                    of fundamentally flawed ideas that with it that I've since abandoned. It's still
                    my favorite looking version, though.

                <h3>First working chest hall</h3>
                <p>
                    It was an insane moment the first time I dumped a packet of items into this hall
                    and watched it pull the code from the item, select the right chest coordinates,
                    read the fill levels on the chest, do the destination computation, organize the
                    packet, feed the items to the chest, and shut itself back down. Took me more
                    than a year to get there. 'Course, it was a slow, unreliable, piece of junk, but
                    so much went into that-everything I build is extremely modular, so I got about a
                    dozen really useful modules doing the R&D to get there.

                <h3>Bitmask based read only binary decoder</h3>
                <p>
                    This one might be the component I'm most proud of. Stateless binary decoders
                    normally work by inverting the signal, then processing both S and S⁻¹ from
                    separate rail lines in such a way to select only the correct slice. This design
                    uses different timings to send both S and S⁻¹ on the same rail lines which
                    allows for a smaller, faster(quarter second) decoder at the cost of some
                    additional lag.

                <h3>Instant intermediate storage</h3>
                <p>
                    I've been working on a call system where you can throw an item on the ground in
                    the chest hall, and it'll give you a packet of 1728 of that item. I don't wanna
                    stand around waiting for it to process the item, so I've set myself a cutoff of
                    4 seconds. However, bulk storages are always going to be slow, as they have
                    different priorities, to handle moving and storing millions of items without
                    causing lag. This stores up to 9 of those packets for each item, and uses
                    <strike>exploits</strike> totally intended with update order to react instantly
                    and effectively teleport packets to the player. From signal to item arriving,
                    it's a quarter second.

                <h3>Planning hub</h3>
                <p>
                    Yeah, this makes sense to exactly one person ever, but it's a scale model of the
                    facility, with notes, issues, ideas, teleport buttons, etc. I swear it's well
                    organized.

                <h3>Sorted hall</h3>
                <p>
                    Honestly, this is super lazy, but it's the working plan for how the items will
                    be sorted in the final chest hall. The position actually determines the code for
                    the item, as the binary is actually a coordinate. (check the
                    <a href="../about/">about page</a> for more info)

                <h3>50ish versions of the chest hall</h3>
                <p>
                    I always fantasized about a minecraft version of git. You can probably see why.
